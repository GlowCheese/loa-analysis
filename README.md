## LOA Analysis

Yet a simple project to analyse LOA's performance on solving global optimization on continuous functions with other mainstream heuristic algorithms (GA, MMAS, ...).

### Requirements:

Tested on Python 3.10.14 (PyPy 7.3.17) with the following packages:
```
pip install tqdm
pip install colorama
```

### Contributions:

Contributions on new optimization functions (with many local minima) and new algorithms are welcomed!

You can fork a repo and:
- Add new functions by modifying `opti_functions.py` file, or
- Add new algorithm by adding the source code in `algorithms` folder.

Finally, just create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/GlowCheese/loa-analysis/pulls) and wait for review. Valid implementation will be followed by running an analysis test.
